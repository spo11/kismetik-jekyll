In a rather geeky conversation I had with my friends, the topic of Linux came up. Surprisingly the person who brought it up wasn't me. This person had an unpleasant experience with a linux distro in their computer science class, a sentiment which another friend of mine echoed regarding their experience with their computer science class.

I find it unfortunate that the instructors of such courses do not seem to clarify that the flavour of linux they use to teach students is not representative of all linux distros. Without clarifying this they inadvertently turn off people less inclined to the technical aspects of computing to linux distributions in general. 

We have a plethora of operating systems based on the linux kernel available in all sorts of configurations. Many of the most popular ones like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, have progressed to the point where installation is a graphical process that has been designed with new users in mind.  I feel that we have reached a point in linux development where we have so many choices that every demographic of users can find a linux os of choice.
