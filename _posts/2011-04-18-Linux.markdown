I am thoroughly obsessed with desktop customization. So obsessed am I, in fact, that I decided to install Arch Linux as my only operating system. It truly is a computer control freak's operating system as the base install consists of a console window and a package manager (called *pacman*). Unlike some other distributions, Arch does not come pre-loaded with any desktop environment or window manager. You choose and installthese yourself.

### Differences between a window manager and a desktop environment

A *window manager* (WM) is just that: a program that manages your windows. There are two types of window managers: tiling ones, and floating ones. In a tiling one, you do not usually have the traditional titlebar, and can arrange the windows side by side without resizing it yourself.

A *desktop environment* (DE) is a set of applications and GUI tools. GNOME is an example of this in that it comes with a set of applications the developers decided were necessary. 

### Going DE-less

When I used Ubuntu, I never really used a lot of the applications that came with the GNOME desktop. So switching to Arch Linux gave me the freedom to go DE-less without messing up the system as I did when I attempted to go DE-less with a standard Ubuntu install (though it is possible to do that with ubuntu-minimal).

Going DE-less meant having to set up a lot of things myself, which was fine with me. 

For a WM, I went with a standalone, tiling WM called [*subtle*](http://subtle.subforge.org). Subtle is configurable through a ruby file that sits in your <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>. 

I then installed some [lightweight applications](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lightweight_Applications), many of which were command-line based or very light on system resources. 

### Bottom line?

Minimalism is awesome.
