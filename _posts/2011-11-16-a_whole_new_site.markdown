<p class="intro">This site has gone through multiple incarnations in the past
year. It's been more than 6 months since this site's inception and it's gotten
more facelifts than an aging Hollywood dame.  </p>

## A Brief History

It began as a simple site to log my adventures in programming and in linux development and has since mutated to this monstrosity. 

It started out as a Jekyll-generated static site, then morphed into its morally reprehensible alter-ego Hyde. Briefly, it was also a nanoc site. 

Fortunately, the good doctor Jekyll has, unlike his novelistic counterpart, overcome the fragmentation of identity his alter ego threatens. 

## Alpha Version

This is really just an alpha version of this new design, but I needed something to put on my new domain. In the coming weeks, I intend to implement some new features.
