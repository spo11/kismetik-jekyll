As if I didn't have enough distractions with which to procrastinate, I started this site.I decided that my geeky interests needed some sort of place on earth so that I can up my geek cred by infinity.

So here it is, a site managed using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). No, not the Doctor Henry Jekyll of *The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde* (though that would certainly be an interesting experience indeed, having a blog managed by a character representing the duality of the human spirit). I decided to run it on a *static website generator* so that I won't have to worry about MySQL being hacked or some other sort of issue that accompanies a dynamic site.

### My excuses

I need to keep *Boredom* at bay when I'm at school, and blogging/programming keeps the Boredom away. All work and no play causes me dismay. 

(I felt like rhyming the previous line, okay?)
