After a few minutes of frustration trying to install [indicator-appmenu](http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=43266) from the AUR, I decided to update the PKGBUILD myself. This of course induced a strange PKGBUILD updating frenzy, so I uploaded everything to my [github](https://github.com/spo11/archlinux).
